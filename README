This script will:
  1) Determine the external IP address of the current computer.
  2) Do a GeoIP lookup on that IP to determine info about this 
     computer's current location.
  3) Return this info.
This can be used to, for instance, have a current and correct (usually 
correct enough) zip when retrieving online weather data or movie listings.  
I wrote it specifically to interact with a weather plugin I used to use 
with conky.

You do need to have the Geo::IP CPAN module installed and a GeoIPCity.dat 
file available. Both of these things used to be, and probably still are, 
available in Debian's apt.
